    Authenticate all users with Mattermost</a>.
</div>
<div>
    Please see <a href="https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/oauth-2-0-applications.html#id3">Mattermost documentation
    on oAuth</a>. Create an app for Jenkins, get the client id and secret, and input the Mattermost base URL.
    I suggest not setting security to logged in users only until you've successfully tested the authtentication.
